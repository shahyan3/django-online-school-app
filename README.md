The goal of release 1 is to build a solid foundation of core features for the site. Primarily, the site is intended for use as a class rostering and organisation tool for the school. Release 1 aims to give a basic rostering system, that allows students to sign up to classes, and give both teachers and students the ability to check when they have classes. 

Class Timetable
The most critical feature of the site is the rostering system. All other features of the site depend on, or are dependent on features that depend on, the ability to organise and view classes. From a practical standpoint, the ability to view a timetable at any time from any device is extremely valuable. It enables users to keep themselves organised without having to rely on memory or keeping track of paperwork.

Student Accounts
Creating student accounts will allow students to register into classes and provide a paperless way of collecting and storing information about students that is needed for school operations. It automates the student signup process, freeing up admin time for more important tasks. Creating student accounts enables students to pick when they want their classes, allowing flexibility and minimising potential conflicts arising from a third party signing them up without a full and correct understanding of each student’s availability. It also allows the school to automate their due diligence with underage students, ensuring that parental details are collected, and the minimum age is enforced

Teacher Accounts
This feature set focuses on developing the core functionality around teacher accounts. These accounts allow easier organisation for both the school and teacher. Assigning teachers to classes ensures all teachers in the system are utilized and enables the school administrator to track and manage teacher/classes effectively. Teachers are able to view upcoming classes, and this allows them to organize their upcoming lessons, and schedule their days accordingly.


User self-management
We moved forward these tasks from Release 2. We had spare dev time, and these features were straightforward, didn’t depend on other tasks, and had a high ratio of value:time during a busy dev period. Below is their description from Release 2:
The user self-management feature set ensure a better user experience for both the students, teachers and the school administrator by giving them access to view manage, edit and update their relevant data including student/teacher contract, profile and account information. Displaying social media links on the website also aids in the expansion of the school’s brand.

Student Additional Features
Initially, allowing students to view their upcoming classes was a release 2 task. This was because students enrolling into classes was a sprint 2 task, and viewing enrolled classes depends on the ability to enrol. However, as there was spare time after the enrolment feature was added, and because it was very similar in terms of coding logic to teachers viewing their classes, it was bought forward into sprint 2/release 1. This is a feature that is extremely handy for the students, it would be very difficult to stay organised without it.

Instrument Inventory & Hire
The importance of this feature set lays in its inherent value to the school administrator as a instrument inventory tracking system. The ability for students to hire instruments from the school both allows them the convenience of owning an instrument for them to practise with, whilst also being an extra source income for the school. The student will be able to access a list of available instruments on the website, which allows for easy selection of an instrument for them to hire. Having the administrator have access to a list of currently hired instruments and the names of whoever has hired them, allows them to view and track the inventory and the condition of the instruments.

User self-management
The user self-management feature set ensure a better user experience for both the students, teachers and the school administrator by giving them access to view manage, edit and update their relevant data including student/teacher contract, profile and account information. Displaying social media links on the website also aids in the expansion of the school’s brand.

Student & Teacher Additional Features
This feature set focuses around features that were deemed useful but not essential in regard to students and teachers. Students viewing upcoming classes on the website aids them in planning their day around the scheduled lesson. Another feature related to teachers is the ability to run a report which returns relevant data for classes that teacher runs giving admin the ability to print out class lists analyse data based on student’s attendance and their results. The ability to provide feedback ensures that the future of the school is secured because the syllabus, teaching styles and class layouts are constantly improved.
